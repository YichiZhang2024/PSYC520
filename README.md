# Robust Alignment

The alignment optimization (Asparouhov & Muth√©n, 2014) allows approximate invariance testing without requiring strict equality constraints. However, it is sensitive to violations such as outliers, group imbalance, and non-normality. This class project introduces a robust extension to the original method, designed to improve parameter recovery and model fit in the presence of these real-world challenges.
