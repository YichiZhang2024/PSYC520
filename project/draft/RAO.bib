	abstract = {This article presents a new method for multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), referred to as the alignment method. The alignment method can be used to estimate group-specific factor means and variances without requiring exact measurement invariance. A strength of the method is the ability to conveniently estimate models for many groups. The method is a valuable alternative to the currently used multiple-group CFA methods for studying measurement invariance that require multiple manual model adjustments guided by modification indexes. Multiple-group CFA is not practical with many groups due to poor model fit of the scalar model and too many large modification indexes. In contrast, the alignment method is based on the configural model and essentially automates and greatly simplifies measurement invariance analysis. The method also provides a detailed account of parameter invariance for every model parameter in every group.},

The effect of nonnormally distributed data or data contamination on the normal-distribution-based likelihood ratio (LR) statistic is well understood due to many analytical and empirical studies. In SEM, fit indices are used as widely as the LR statistic. In addition to NML, robust procedures have been developed for more efficient and less biased parameter estimates with practical data. This article studies the effect of outliers and leverage observations on fit indices following NML and two robust methods. Analysis and empirical results indicate that good leverage observations following NML and one of the robust methods lead most fit indices to give more support to the substantive model. While outliers tend to make a good model superficially bad according to many fit indices following NML, they have little effect on those following the two robust procedures. Implications of the results to data analysis are discussed, and recommendations are provided regarding the use of estimation methods and interpretation of fit indices.

Several robust methods in model fitting and testing are proposed. These include direct estimation of M-estimators of structured parameters and a two-stage procedure based on robust M- and S-estimators of population covariances. The large sample properties of these estimators are obtained. The equivalence between a direct M-estimator and a two-stage estimator based on an M-estimator of population covariance is established when sampling from an elliptical distribution. Two test statistics are presented in judging the adequacy of a hypothesized model; both are asymptotically distribution free if using distribution free weight matrices. So these test statistics possess both finite sample and large sample robustness. The two-stage procedures can be easily adapted into standard software packages by modifying existing asymptotically distribution free procedures. To demonstrate the two-stage procedure, S-estimator and M-estimators under different weight functions are calculated for some real data sets.},

	abstract = {Existing methods for structural equation modeling involve fitting the ordinary sample covariance matrix by a proposed structural model. Since a sample covariance is easily influenced by a few outlying cases, the standard practice of modeling sample covariances can lead to inefficient estimates as well as inflated fit indices. By giving a proper weight to each individual case, a robust covariance will have a bounded influence function as well as a nonzero breakdown point. These robust properties of the covariance estimators will be carried over to the parameter estimators in the structural model if a technically appropriate procedure is used. We study such a procedure in which robust covariances replace ordinary sample covariances in the context of the Wishart likelihood function. This procedure is easy to implement in practice. Statistical properties of this procedure are investigated. A fit index is given based on sampling from an elliptical distribution. An estimating equation approach is used to develop a variety of robust covariances, and consistent covariances of these robust estimators, needed for standard errors and test statistics, follow from this approach. Examples illustrate the inflated statistics and distorted parameter estimates obtained by using sample covariances when compared with those obtained by using robust covariances. The merits of each method and its relevance to specific types of data are discussed.},

A very general model is presented, in which any parameter in the factor analysis models (factor loadings, factor variances, factor covariances, and unique variances) for the different groups may be assigned an arbitrary value or constrained to be equal to some other parameter. Given such a specification, the model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method yielding a large sample chi2 of goodness of fit. Various hypotheses can be tested by computing several solutions under different specifications. The method is capable of dealing with any degree of invariance. Neither the number of tests nor the number of common factors need to be the same for all groups, but it is assumed that there is a common core of tests in each battery that is the same or comparable.

By comparing the most credible values (i.e. 95\% HDI) with a region of practical equivalence (ROPE), the Bayesian approach allows researchers to (1) support the null hypothesis of practical invariance, and (2) examine the practical importance of the noninvariant parameter. Compared to the traditional likelihood ratio test, simulation results suggested that the proposed Bayesian approach could offer additional insight into evaluating factorial invariance, thus, leading to more informative conclusions. We provide an empirical example to demonstrate the procedures necessary to implement the proposed method in applied research.

	abstract = {Measurement invariance-the notion that the measurement properties of a scale are equal across groups, contexts, or time-is an important assumption underlying much of psychology research. The traditional approach for evaluating measurement invariance is to fit a series of nested measurement models using multiple-group confirmatory factor analyses. However, traditional approaches are strict, vary across the field in implementation, and present multiplicity challenges, even in the simplest case of two groups under study. The alignment method was recently proposed as an alternative approach. This method is more automated, requires fewer decisions from researchers, and accommodates two or more groups. However, it has different assumptions, estimation techniques, and limitations from traditional approaches. To address the lack of accessible resources that explain the methodological differences and complexities between the two approaches, we introduce and illustrate both, comparing them side by side. First, we overview the concepts, assumptions, advantages, and limitations of each approach. Based on this overview, we propose a list of four key considerations to help researchers decide which approach to choose and how to document their analytical decisions in a preregistration or analysis plan. We then demonstrate our key considerations on an illustrative research question using an open dataset and provide an example of a completed preregistration. Our illustrative example is accompanied by an annotated analysis report that shows readers, step-by-step, how to conduct measurement invariance tests using R and Mplus. Finally, we provide recommendations for how to decide between and use each approach and next steps for methodological research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).},
