	abstract = {This article presents a new method for multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), referred to as the alignment method. The alignment method can be used to estimate group-specific factor means and variances without requiring exact measurement invariance. A strength of the method is the ability to conveniently estimate models for many groups. The method is a valuable alternative to the currently used multiple-group CFA methods for studying measurement invariance that require multiple manual model adjustments guided by modification indexes. Multiple-group CFA is not practical with many groups due to poor model fit of the scalar model and too many large modification indexes. In contrast, the alignment method is based on the configural model and essentially automates and greatly simplifies measurement invariance analysis. The method also provides a detailed account of parameter invariance for every model parameter in every group.},

	abstract = {Test scores on 26 different measures were obtained from a total of 300 7th and 8th grade students in two schools. In one school most of the parents were foreign born, in the other chiefly American born. Bi-factor analysis has been applied to the intercorrelations of test scores for each group separately. The loadings of one general and four group factors were determined for each school. Comparison of the results for the two groups indicates that, "generally speaking, the test material determines what factors may be measured by the tests and that the nature of the group tested determines, in large measure, the actual size of the factor weights."

	abstract = {Normal-distribution-based maximum likelihood (NML) is the most widely used method in structural equation modeling (SEM), although practical data tend to be nonnormally distributed. The effect of nonnormally distributed data or data contamination on the normal-distribution-based likelihood ratio (LR) statistic is well understood due to many analytical and empirical studies. In SEM, fit indices are used as widely as the LR statistic. In addition to NML, robust procedures have been developed for more efficient and less biased parameter estimates with practical data. This article studies the effect of outliers and leverage observations on fit indices following NML and two robust methods. Analysis and empirical results indicate that good leverage observations following NML and one of the robust methods lead most fit indices to give more support to the substantive model. While outliers tend to make a good model superficially bad according to many fit indices following NML, they have little effect on those following the two robust procedures. Implications of the results to data analysis are discussed, and recommendations are provided regarding the use of estimation methods and interpretation of fit indices.

	abstract = {Covariance structure analysis is used to evaluate hypothesized influences among unmeasured latent and observed variables. As implemented, it is not robust to outliers and bad data. Several robust methods in model fitting and testing are proposed. These include direct estimation of M-estimators of structured parameters and a two-stage procedure based on robust M- and S-estimators of population covariances. The large sample properties of these estimators are obtained. The equivalence between a direct M-estimator and a two-stage estimator based on an M-estimator of population covariance is established when sampling from an elliptical distribution. Two test statistics are presented in judging the adequacy of a hypothesized model; both are asymptotically distribution free if using distribution free weight matrices. So these test statistics possess both finite sample and large sample robustness. The two-stage procedures can be easily adapted into standard software packages by modifying existing asymptotically distribution free procedures. To demonstrate the two-stage procedure, S-estimator and M-estimators under different weight functions are calculated for some real data sets.},

	abstract = {Existing methods for structural equation modeling involve fitting the ordinary sample covariance matrix by a proposed structural model. Since a sample covariance is easily influenced by a few outlying cases, the standard practice of modeling sample covariances can lead to inefficient estimates as well as inflated fit indices. By giving a proper weight to each individual case, a robust covariance will have a bounded influence function as well as a nonzero breakdown point. These robust properties of the covariance estimators will be carried over to the parameter estimators in the structural model if a technically appropriate procedure is used. We study such a procedure in which robust covariances replace ordinary sample covariances in the context of the Wishart likelihood function. This procedure is easy to implement in practice. Statistical properties of this procedure are investigated. A fit index is given based on sampling from an elliptical distribution. An estimating equation approach is used to develop a variety of robust covariances, and consistent covariances of these robust estimators, needed for standard errors and test statistics, follow from this approach. Examples illustrate the inflated statistics and distorted parameter estimates obtained by using sample covariances when compared with those obtained by using robust covariances. The merits of each method and its relevance to specific types of data are discussed.},
