The current research proposed robust alignment optimization (RAO), a two-stage procedure that can accurately estimate factor means with the existence of influential observations while taking account of measurement bias. Specifically, this procedure first obtains the robust covariance matrix and then conducts alignment on the obtained matrix. We described six types of robust covariance matrices in detail: Mahalanobis Distance with MVE, Mahalanobis Distance with MCD, Projection Distance with MVE (random), Projection Distance with MCD (random), Projection Distance with MVE (exhaustive), Projection Distance with MCD (exhaustive). The illustrative example showed the Projection Distance methods with exhaustive search performed the best among all methods in recovering covariance matrix and providing accurate parameter estimates with the existence of leverage points. 

The proposed procedure has several advantages. First, data contamination is common in applied research, but it has been overlooked in the current literature of measurement invariance. The conventional methods are sensitve to influential observations that even a single outlying observation could bias the MI testing results. In contrast, the developed RAO procedure could produce consistent and efficient estimation with the existence of influential observations. 

In this project, we only modified the data so that it contains leverage observations. To test the full effect of above-mentioned data contamination detection techniques and their corresponding alignment indices, outliers and bad leverage observations are needed to be further studies. In addition, we conducted a two-stage robust procedure (TSR) in our study. However, a direct robust method (DR) has also been suggested by @yuan2013, in which distances are directly used in the computation of the robust covariance matrix. Further analyses are needed to compare which method performs better in either stage. Furthermore, a simulation study will be ideal to set a ground truth so one can decide if the data contamination detection techniques are identifying unusual observations as they are supposed to, since we cannot guarantee the original data set that we used are free of such contamination. Lastly, the model used in the illustrative example is saturated, so model fit statistics such as root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR) are missing. Future study should apply RAO on a different example and evaluate the performance of the proposed procedure.
