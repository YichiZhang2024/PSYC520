## Background

One important assumption of using psychological scales to compare groups or select individuals is that these scales perform equivalently across people with different backgrounds.

## Method

1.  robust covariance matrix

The second step is to apply the alignment optimization on the obtained robust covariance matrix. This could be achieved by first fitting a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model using the robust covariance matrix, obtaining robust parameter estimates (e.g., factor loadings, intercepts) from the fitted model, and then conducting alignment on these estimates. 

Here the component loss function $f$, can be set as $f(x) = \sqrt{\sqrt{x^2 + \epsilon}}$ with $\epsilon$ being a small number (i.e., 0.0001). 

\begin{align}
    F &= \sum_p \sum_{k_1 < k_2}w_{k_1,k_2}f(\lambda_{jk1,1} -\lambda_{jk2,1}) \\ &+ \sum_p \sum_{k_1 < k_2}w_{k_1,k_2}f(\nu_{jk1,1} -\nu_{jk2,1}) 
\end{align}
