## Background

Educational or psychological researchers are often interested in assessing people's latent traits that are not directly observable (i.e., self-efficacy). One commonly used assessment method is to develop psychological scales and ask people to rate the scale items. However, an important assumption of using psychological scales is measurement invariance (MI), meaning the scales have the same measurement properties for people from different groups. By establishing MI, researchers could compare latent means across groups while holding measurement parameters invariant. However, exact invariance is often rejected in applied research, so the alignment optimization has been proposed to accurately estimate the latent trait means without requiring the exact invariance across groups [@asparouhov2014]. 

<!-- Specifically, alignment automates the MI analysis by minimizing a loss function that captures the amount of measurement noninvariance across items and groups -->

However, alignment is based on multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA), which is not robust to outliers or influential observations......[Lai: add the part about robust covariance matrix]

## Method

1.  robust covariance matrix

The second step is to apply the alignment optimization on the obtained robust covariance matrix. This could be achieved by first fitting a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model using the robust covariance matrix, obtaining robust parameter estimates (e.g., factor loadings, intercepts) from the fitted model, and then conducting alignment on these estimates. 

Here the component loss function $f$, can be set as $f(x) = \sqrt{\sqrt{x^2 + \epsilon}}$ with $\epsilon$ being a small number (i.e., 0.0001). 

\begin{align}
    F &= \sum_p \sum_{k_1 < k_2}w_{k_1,k_2}f(\lambda_{jk1,1} -\lambda_{jk2,1}) \\ &+ \sum_p \sum_{k_1 < k_2}w_{k_1,k_2}f(\nu_{jk1,1} -\nu_{jk2,1}) 
\end{align}
